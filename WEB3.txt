web3 is new internet
web3 describe the third stage of the web
instead of using encryption blockchain uses hashing
hasing is very similar to encryption
to go back from hash to normal we have to brute force it
nounce is combined with data to produce hash
canister in motoko is called actor
to change the value of variable we use := sign
print allows to put text in funciton
print function expects something that is piece of text of type nat which is a natural number
debug_show helps us to print the values inside the actor
var creates a variable
let value do cannot change
let is a constant
to import liblary we use mo:base
to create a function we use func keyword and then name
function which is only accessiable in one actor is called private function\
to call function from anywhere we have to add public in front of the function
use uppercamelcase for type names (including classes or type parameters), module names and actor
use lowercamelcase for all other names, including constants and variant fields
candid is an interface description language
Nat is natural number
when we use dfx deploy all of our variables get reset
we can assing data types using :{data type}
query calls --> allow the user to query the current state of a canister or call a function that operates on the canister's state without changing it
update calls --> allow the user to change the state of the canister and have changes persisted
to use query calls we use query keyword in the function
to add presistence to the code we use stable keyword in fornt of var
:= replace operator
time moudle is in base liblary of motoko
to write power in motoko we use 2 **
cyles allows us todeploy our creation onto the live icp network
NNS - network nervous system
nns basically is a governing system that controls all aspects of the internet computer
